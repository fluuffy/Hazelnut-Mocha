# Hazelnut-Mocha
I copied and updated a few things from Bill's code (found here: https://github.com/blovegro/carsmart)
Credit for this goes to him.
In this project, I'll be trying to intergrate the Huzzah! ESP8266  to work along with the OBD2-UART board from sparkfun.
Here's hoping I don't have to make my own board for this project!
